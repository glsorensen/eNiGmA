## Final Independent Backend Project | Turing School | 2111 Cohort


### Self Assessment

#### Functionality (3): The program completes all of Iteration 3

#### Object Oriented Programming(3): 
Program uses several modules and I am happy that the plan I had going into the coding with led to clean architecture.

#### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics(1.5): 
I feel that while I ended with a solid project, I feel that I needed to access to many outside sources for this to be where it is now. While my structure would have been the same, I would not have been able to complete the methods, and if I did they would be extremly smelly.

#### Test Driven Development(2.5): 
While most tests were written before I coded, I would say I still need some work on that. Edge cases are addressed for any components of the program that are interacted with by a user (CLI). SimpleCov results are 98% coverage.

#### Overall Score: 2.5 

##### I would say a learned a lot in this project, probably the biggest was my ability to read code. I feel pretty good with project orginization/planning/architecture (even though that took me hours to figure out). As for the actual coding, I had to get a lot of help from many sources. While I am happy where I ended up, I will say most of it came from the input or inspiration others ideas (mentor, rock). My Ruby mechanics and technical skills need a lot of work. If I tried to work through these methods on my own there would have been no chance for me to finish the whole project at my current skill level.
